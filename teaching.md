Groundbreaking feminist theorist bell hooks argues that &quot;To educate as the practice of freedom is a way of teaching that anyone can learn.&quot; The spirit of critical and feminist pedagogy motivates me to take up this challenge in the library classroom and encourage learners to participate in the learning process as their full and authentic selves. My experience working in community-based archives like the June L Mazer Lesbian Archives and facilitating both virtual classroom visits and consciousness-raising groups undergirds my commitment to building an empowering classroom community where students can question the power structures that structure information and scholarship and critically engage with the archives of difficult histories. My feminist approach to primary source literacy encourages learners to both understand and question practices of archival accessioning, representation, and access. First hand encounters with archival collections facilitate deep engagement with texts and their historical context. Ultimately, I attempt to work with learners so they develop confidence in their own voices and their ability to evaluate and question information sources. I hope such a learning community leaves them ready to question information and injustice in their daily lives.
